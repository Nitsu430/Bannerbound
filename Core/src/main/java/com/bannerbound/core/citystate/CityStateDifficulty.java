/**
 * Difficulty of AI city-states -- how fast they accrue tradeable materials and advance their own
 * research. Higher difficulty means a more populous / industrious neighbour, NOT a thin-air
 * multiplier (see CITY_STATES plan 1D): the factor scales believable levers (effective population,
 * work speed), so a HARD city-state simply behaves like a bigger, busier town. Default
 * {@link #MEDIUM}; configurable via {@code Config.CITY_STATE_DIFFICULTY}, but per
 * {@code neoforge-config-persistence} an existing run's TOML won't pick up a changed default.
