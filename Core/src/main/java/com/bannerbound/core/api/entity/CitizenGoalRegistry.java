/**
 * Public extension point for adding an <b>auxiliary</b> (non-job) AI goal to every citizen from any
 * mod - Core or an expansion - without editing {@code CitizenEntity.registerGoals}. The sibling
 * {@link com.bannerbound.core.api.job.CitizenJobRegistry} wires whole jobs (work goals + anarchy +
 * research + icons); this one is for plain leisure/behaviour goals that need none of that - a citizen
 * wandering to a refreshment block, a seasonal idle, and so on.
 *
 * <p>As with the job registry, the factory is a {@code (citizen, speedModifier) -> Goal} lambda, so
 * Core never references the consumer's goal class - an expansion's goal lives entirely in the
 * expansion while still being attached to Core's {@link CitizenEntity}. Register during common setup
 * at a {@code goalSelector} priority on the same scale as Core's built-in goals (lower wins; work is
 * 3, patrol/anarchy 4, idle look 5+). Registration is order-preserving and thread-safe; {@code all()}
 * returns an immutable snapshot.
