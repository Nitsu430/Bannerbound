/**
 * Gates production at placed workstations (crafting stone, mortar &amp; pestle, bloomery): a station
 * can only produce an item its owning civ recognizes. The owner is the settlement that has the
 * station's chunk claimed - a block entity has no inherent player, and passive stations like the
 * bloomery run with nobody present, so territory ownership is the natural "whose knowledge applies"
 * answer. (The portable vanilla crafting grid is gated against the player's settlement
 * instead - see {@code CraftingMenuMixin}.)
 * <p>
 * Mirrors the drop side: knowledge = global starting items + the owning settlement's research
 * unlocks; no owner (unclaimed land) -&gt; starting items only. Always permissive on the client and
 * when there's no server context - the server is authoritative.
