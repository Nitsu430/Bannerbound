/**
 * Server-side mutual-exclusion for work blocks: while a citizen crafts at a station, player
 * interaction with it is rejected - and while a player runs a station session (e.g. the fletching
 * minigame), NPCs skip it. Transient by design (not persisted): locks clear on restart, and both
 * lock holders re-assert theirs every craft. Keyed by position; values are the holder's UUID
 * (citizen or player). {@code forceUnlock} drops a lock regardless of holder for when the station
 * block itself is destroyed, so a rebuilt block at the same pos never inherits a stale claim.
