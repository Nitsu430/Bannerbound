/**
 * Server-side blueprint push: expands the settlement's frozen {@link WallPlan} (against the default
 * design set - the library plugs in here in Phase 5), bakes the wall connections so the ghosts show
 * the EXACT states that will be built, and ships it to settlement members as
 * {@code WallBlueprintSyncPayload}. Called on construct/cancel/adapt and on login; a settlement
 * without a plan syncs an empty payload, clearing the client's ghosts.
 *
 * <p>{@link #sendPlanPreview} ships an arbitrary, possibly UNCOMMITTED plan's ghosts to a single
 * player (the "walk around and inspect before committing" preview); the next committed-state sync
 * (construct, login, plan change) replaces it.
