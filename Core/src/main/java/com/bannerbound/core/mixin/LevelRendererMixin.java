/**
 * Suppresses VANILLA's star pass so the faith sky can take its place (FAITH_PLAN, "the heavens wheel
 * once a year"): Bannerbound renders every star itself on the yearly-rotating sphere, so vanilla's
 * daily-rotating stars would shear apart from ours. The @Redirect returns 0 for getStarBrightness so
 * vanilla's star draw inside renderSky is skipped entirely.
 *
 * The faith sky itself is NO LONGER drawn here; it moved to FaithSkyRenderer's
 * RenderLevelStageEvent.AFTER_WEATHER handler. Drawing inside renderSky happened BEFORE terrain, so
 * the depth buffer was empty and Iris's deferred pipeline composited the celestial geometry without
 * testing it against terrain depth - stars showed through hills under a shaderpack. Drawing
 * post-terrain against the populated depth buffer (depth-test LEQUAL) lets terrain occlude the stars
 * in BOTH the vanilla and Iris paths. Guard: until the sky seed has synced (or with no data at all),
 * vanilla stars render untouched.
