/**
 * Client -> server: pin an assigned worker to a specific station family within the workshop (the
 * Workers tab's per-worker station chooser). A mixed workshop holds several station families (e.g.
 * a fletching station and a crafting stone); this lets the player decide who works which - one a
 * fletcher, one a general crafter - instead of letting them self-assign by spare capacity.
 * stationTypeId is a registered workshop type id; the empty string means "Any" - clear the pin and
 * let the worker auto-pick a station with work (the legacy behaviour).
