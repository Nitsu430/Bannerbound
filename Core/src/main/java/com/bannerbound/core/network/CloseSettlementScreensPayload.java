/**
 * S->C signal: close any Bannerbound settlement-related screen the player has open. Sent to
 * every former member after a disband so a player who was sitting in the town hall / expand-
 * territory / citizen / research / culture screen doesn't end up staring at stale data for a
 * settlement that no longer exists.
 *
 * <p>No fields - the trigger is the whole payload; the client checks the current
 * {@code Minecraft.screen} type and dismisses if it matches any of the known settlement
 * screens. Cheap: one packet per former member, no per-screen specialisation.
