/**
 * Server -> client: open the "Tribe vote" reveal screen, sent to every settlement member when a
 * chief election ends in a tie and the citizens are about to break it. Each row in the parallel
 * lists voterNames / candidateNames is one citizen's vote, ordered the way they will appear (the
 * client reveals them one at a time with an exponentially-shortening delay - first vote slow, last
 * vote fast). The screen is purely cosmetic: the actual chief-enactment is server-scheduled to fire
 * after the reveal completes, so players who closed the screen still see the chat broadcast and the
 * elected Chief takes effect identically.
