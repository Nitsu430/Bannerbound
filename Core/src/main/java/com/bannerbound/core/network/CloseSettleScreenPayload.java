/**
 * S->C signal: close the settlement-founding screen ({@code SettleScreen}) if the player has it
 * open. Broadcast to everyone the moment the last banner color is claimed - once the server is
 * full no founding can succeed, so any open founding menu must be dismissed.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately narrower than {@link CloseSettlementScreensPayload}: that one closes every
 * settlement screen (town hall, citizens, research, ...) for a player whose settlement disbanded.
 * This one targets <em>only</em> the founding screen, so broadcasting it to the whole server
 * doesn't collateral-close established settlements' town-hall menus.
