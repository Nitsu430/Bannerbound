/**
 * Server-wide reservation of OPEN herder pens (those not bound to a specific citizen), so multiple herders
 * spread across the available pens instead of all piling onto the first one. Mirrors {@link DiggerClaims}:
 * a pen's anchor {@link BlockPos} maps to the entity id of the herder working it; another herder skips a pen
 * claimed by a still-living herder, so it naturally picks a different pen. A claim whose owner no longer
 * exists (died / unloaded without cleanup) is treated as stale and cleared on access, freeing the pen.
 *
 * <p>Bound pens (assigned to one citizen) don't go through here -- they're private to that citizen and need
 * no race. Server-thread only in practice; the map is concurrent for safety. isClaimedByOther clears a
 * claim whose owner has vanished and reports the pen free; ownedBy lets a herder prefer its current pen;
 * claim reserves/refreshes; releaseAll drops every reservation when the herder stops or changes pens.
