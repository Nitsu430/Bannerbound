/**
 * Fisher {@link GathererWorkGoal} — a self-directed gatherer (no Foreman's Rod). It scans for a
 * stand tile beside open water within its settlement's claims, walks there, casts a
 * {@link FisherBobber} into deep open water, waits for a bite, reels in a catch from
 * {@link FisherCatchTable}, and deposits it into its marked drop-off. Stand tiles are soft-locked
 * through {@link FisherShoreRegistry} so two fishers never share a spot. The Job tab for a fisher is
 * minimal: a fishing-rod tool slot + a drop-off location.
 *
 * <h2>Casting that actually lands in the lake</h2>
 * The hard part of a believable fisher is that the {@link FisherBobber} <em>sticks to the first
 * water it touches</em> (see {@link FisherBobber#tick}). A naïve "lob roughly toward deep water"
 * either thunks the float into a tree/bank or drops it on the shallow shelf at the lake's edge —
 * exactly the broken behaviour we're replacing. So instead of guessing, we <b>simulate the bobber's
 * own ballistic physics</b> for a fan of candidate launch velocities ({@link #simulateLanding}) and
 * keep only a launch we proved lands in open water without clipping terrain first. Crucially the
 * throw is re-solved at cast time ({@link #solveArc}) from the citizen's <em>actual</em> position —
 * not the stand tile it was aiming for — so even if it stops a block short of the spot, the float
 * still arcs into the water rather than onto the bank. If no arc reaches water from where it ended
 * up, it steps back onto the spot and retries instead of casting blind.
 *
 * <p>Stand tiles are then ranked by where their <em>best</em> arc lands: depth and openness dominate,
 * then a shorter flight breaks ties. Because a pier puts the fisher right up against deep water, its
 * short arc into deep water out-scores a long arc lobbed off the bank over the shallows — so a fisher
 * naturally prefers a pier over the shore without any special-casing.
