/**
 * A campfire that renders WITHOUT its flame (just the glowing logs) -- the {@code stone_cooking_pot}
 * swaps a vanilla campfire for this while a pot sits on top, so the pot can rest down in the fire
 * without the flame poking up through it, then swaps it back when the pot is removed (see {@link
 * StoneCookingPotBlock}). A real block change always re-meshes, so this works under any renderer
 * (Sodium/Iris included) -- unlike model-data tricks that race the chunk build.
 *
 * <p>Extends {@link CampfireBlock} so it stays {@code instanceof CampfireBlock} (the pot's heat checks
 * keep working) and is a FULL campfire -- same light, shape, roasting and block entity (added to the
 * vanilla campfire {@code BlockEntityType} in {@code BannerboundAntiquity}); only its rendered flame is
 * gone (a flame-less log blockstate model). So nothing is lost vs a normal campfire except the flame.
