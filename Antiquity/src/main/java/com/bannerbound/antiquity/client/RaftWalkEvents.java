/**
 * Makes a raft a proper moving platform underfoot: when the local player is standing on a raft's
 * (solid) deck and not riding it, carry them along by the raft's per-tick movement. The raft's deck
 * is already a hard surface (see {@link RaftPart}), but a moving entity doesn't drag a passenger the
 * way a moving block does, so without this you'd slide off the back the moment it moves. Done on the
 * client for the local player only - the player is client-authoritative, so nudging their position
 * here syncs cleanly with no rubber-banding (mobs / remote players just stand, which is fine).
 * The carry applies translation AND rotation: the player's offset from the raft's old centre is
 * spun by the yaw delta, then re-anchored to the new centre, so a turning raft can't swing out from
 * under them (translation-only would). The view is deliberately not rotated - players keep aiming
 * where they look, which is what you want when throwing spears off a turning raft.
