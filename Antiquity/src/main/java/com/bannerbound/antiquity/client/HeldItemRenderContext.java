/**
 * Tracks the {@link LivingEntity} whose model (and therefore held item) is being rendered right now.
 *
 * <p>Held-item baked-model wrappers (e.g. {@link SpearHandFlipModel}) only receive an
 * {@code ItemDisplayContext} from {@code applyTransform} - no entity. Keying their per-render decision
 * on a global like {@code Minecraft#player} causes cross-talk: when the local player raises a spear,
 * <i>every</i> spear on screen flips ("rotating one spear rotates all spears"). This holder lets the
 * wrapper key on the actual entity being drawn instead, so each spear flips independently.
 *
 * <p>Set/cleared per entity by {@link SpearRenderEvents} around the living-entity render (third person,
 * covers other players and citizens) and around the first-person hand render (local player). Render
 * thread only, so a plain static field is sufficient.
