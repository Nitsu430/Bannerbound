 * Suppress a campfire's client display FX (tall smoke column, spark/lava pops, crackle) while
 * a {@link StoneCookingPotBlock} sits directly on top. The pot is rendered down inside the flames, so
 * the campfire's own smoke would pour straight up through the pot (and its flame would peek through);
 * the pot supplies its own simmer particles instead. Plain campfires (no pot) are untouched. Client
 * display tick only; {@code require = 0} so a mappings shift just no-ops rather than crashing.
