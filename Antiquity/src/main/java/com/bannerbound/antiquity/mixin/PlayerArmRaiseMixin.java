/**
 * Raises the third-person hammer arm overhead while a player is cold-hammering at the Stone Anvil,
 * so your own avatar (in F5) and other players nearby see the swing, not just the first-person hand.
 *
 * <p>Injected at the TAIL of {@link PlayerModel#setupAnim} so it overrides the finalised arm pose for
 * the frame. It skips while the player is actively {@code swinging}, letting the vanilla per-strike
 * swing play the down-smack; between strikes the eased raise from {@link HammerArmState} holds the
 * hammer up (MAX_RAISE = -2.2 rad, roughly 126 deg back/overhead at full raise). Non-hammering
 * players are untouched (cheap UUID lookup, returns early).
